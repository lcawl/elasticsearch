This section summarizes the most important changes in each release. It also 
describes the changes that you need to be aware of when migrating your 
application from one version of Elasticsearch to another.

As a general rule:

* Migration between minor versions -- e.g. `7.x` to `7.y` -- can be
  performed by <<rolling-upgrades,upgrading one node at a time>>.

* Migration between consecutive major versions -- e.g. `6.x` to `7.x` --
  requires a <<restart-upgrade,full cluster restart>>.

* Migration between non-consecutive major versions -- e.g. `5.x` to `7.x` --
  is not supported.

For more information, see <<setup-upgrade>>.

For the full list of changes in the release, see <<es-release-notes>>. 

* <<release-7.0.0>>
